# OKTO Problem Statement 2 - Wallet and Transaction System

## Project Description

Welcome to the "OKTO Problem Statement 2" project repository. In this project, we have diligently worked on creating a comprehensive wallet and transaction system with a range of features to address the specific requirements of OKTO. This README provides an overview of what we've accomplished, what's included in this repository, and the current status of our project.

## Project Goals and Achievements

- **UI Development:** We've designed and developed a user-friendly and intuitive user interface (UI) for wallet creation and transaction management. The UI is tailored to provide a seamless user experience.

- **Wallet Management:** Our system allows users to create and manage wallets efficiently. It encompasses critical functionalities like wallet creation, balance checking, and secure storage of digital assets.

- **Transaction Features:** We've implemented a wide array of transaction features including seamless fund transfers, tax deductions, and account abstraction to ensure the security and efficiency of financial interactions.

- **KYC Verification:** To meet regulatory requirements and enhance security, we've integrated KYC (Know Your Customer) verification processes into the wallet system. This ensures that user identities are validated and transactions are secure.

- **Smart Contracts:** Our team has authored and implemented smart contracts that underpin the wallet and transaction functionalities. These contracts are designed to be secure, transparent, and efficient.

- **Dashboard Creation:** A comprehensive dashboard system has been developed to provide users with an overview of wallet activities. This includes transaction history, tax reports, and account details.

## Current Status

While we have successfully developed the core components of this project, including the UI, wallet creation, transaction features, and smart contracts, we have encountered challenges in integrating and deploying the system in its entirety.

Our team is actively working to overcome these challenges and deploy the system as soon as possible. We are committed to delivering a robust and reliable solution that aligns with the goals and expectations of OKTO.But couldnt complete it for now.

Please refer to the project documentation and the individual components in this repository for detailed information and instructions on setting up and running the system.
